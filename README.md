# SamplingMethods
Using sampling algorithms to analyse given data
this is a simple propgramme made by me to solve all types of proplems from this scope that we take in the fault analysis subject I will keep it updated according to
the alghrothems which we study
here I have the Two sample and three sample predictive alghortisms and the Peak-Value predictive alghorithms
