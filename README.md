# SamplingMethods
Using sampling algorithms to analyse given data
this is a simple propgramme made by me to solve all types of proplems from this scope that we take in the fault analysis subject I will keep it updated according to
the alghrothems which we study
here I have the Two sample and three sample predictive alghortisms and the Peak-Value predictive alghorithms 
  to install the GUI app without interacting with the code download this file: 
       https://github.com/ayosif2/SamplingMethods/blob/main/SamplingMethodsGUI.mlappinstall  
         
          
then double click it with matlap installed or open the app tab in MATLAB and install it using the path installation video
